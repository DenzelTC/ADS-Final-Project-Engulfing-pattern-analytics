# ADS-Final-Project-Engulfing-pattern-analytics
Collecting, analyzing the engulfing trading pattern data to find out how useful and how best it can be applied 

I have included a power point slide explaining everything about the project.
The code also has some highlights you help understand what is going on.

PLEASE NOTE :- Due to cloud server runtime memory the project couldn't be visualised from streamlit cloud
i tried all that i could including using chunks to break the .csv file but to no avail.The link is 
"https://ads-final-project-engulfing-pattern-analytics-by-denzel-chikaka.streamlit.app/" 

however every file is included in the project file and once you fork you can change the directory in the Engulf_project 
file and set to your file location - pd.read_csv=(where the EURUSD path )

THANK YOU
